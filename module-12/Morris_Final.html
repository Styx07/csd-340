                            <p>I have loved puzzles my whole life, I have over 100 of them. It does not matter if it is 2D, 3D, or abstract. 
                            This is one reason I got into coding in the first place, it is a puzzle in that you get to make the pieces fit and look how you want. 
                            My love for puzzles has gone to my son, we will do all kinds of puzzles together.</p>

                            <p>Games have also been a big part of my life, I find it is a good way to spend time with family. 
                            I have all kinds of them: board, card, trivia, and even ones for the yard. 
                            My favorites are different versions of Risk, my son wants to learn them but he does not have the patients for such a long game.</p>

                            My son is learning better hand-eye coordination through the use of these.

                            I have now started to teach my son my skills.

                            I did not find out that I am allergic to them until the last 10 years, 
                            but I love my wife, so we have 5 cats and a chinchilla. 
                            We have twin grays Fred and George, yes named after the famed Harry Potter twins (age 10), the black one is Smokey, 
                            my son’s emotional support cat (age 2), the white one Snowball is our first cat (age 12), and Mushu a multicolor, named after the dragon in Mulan (litter mate to the twins) and she does not like her picture taken. 
                            All of them are rescued from under porches and out of dumpsters. 
                            The chinchilla was born to us during Hanukkah so we name him Hans.</p>

                            My son follows me in this, he worked hard and saved up his money to buy his own large Mario Lego Bowser’s Airship. 
                            It took us 6 hours to build it together. 
                            Sometimes we take over the whole dining room table and build all day long.</p>
